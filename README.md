# CS-340-Final-Project
The final project for Client/Server Development at SNHU
### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I found it important to maintain separation between areas of functionality. It was simple enough in this project, but the principle applies to more expansive, complicated projects. By implementing CRUD functionality in a middle layer, I could concern myself with other things on the front end. I could reusability by parameterizing the database, collection, etc. information.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach to meeting the database and dashboard requirements was to quickly meet the bare minimum, then clean up my code and/or make UI improvements. Being a perfectionist, I can spend too much time on things and end up falling behind. Employing this strategy is my way of compensating for this tendency.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

My definition of a computer scientist: a person who studies how computers can be used to solve problems. For work that is mundane, tedious, and repetitive, computers can be used to greatly improve productivity, and a computer scientist is an asset in achieving this goal.
